- [Connect a Raspberry Pi to your Azure IoT Central application (Python)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/iot-central/howto-connect-raspberry-pi-python.md)
- [IoT Hub Raspberry Pi 3 Client application](https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/resources/samples/iot-hub-python-raspberrypi-client-app/).
- [**Smartibot**](https://www.redbull.com/int-en/smartibot-ai-cardboard-robot) – the world’s first cardboard robot packing in artificial intelligence: a robot kit to discover robotics and artificial intelligence **without having to source expensive technology or materials**. The kit itself makes it easy to create a robot out of cardboard, but Atkin is keen to stress that Smartibot can actually be made out of anything – even a potato (yes, the team have already done that) – and the AI side of things are handled by your smartphone and a Smartibot app. You just **place your smartphone in it, so it can see** (would be nice if we could stream the video from a camera in the robot to the smartphone to keep things cheap) [Fresh stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjd_8UMCvPQ).

## [Azure Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/)
Lot of crap to get familiar with, some services overlap. We'll need to select some and have some scripts ready to totally abuse the free credits. I made a list of some intriguing services but there are soo many. 
- **Azure Kinekt DK**: Build computer vision and speech models using a developer kit with advanced AI sensors. *An observer device* (mega camera + microphones) with the usual azure services): [check this out, feb 24 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2URblck97y8). 

- Azure Batch AI: GPU’s. Support any framework (Python, Java, C..) 
- **Azure Machine Learning Service**: GPU's. Integrates with any Python Environment TF, Keras, scikit-learn...
- Azure ML Studio: codeless GUI ML, kinda sucks. 
- Virtual Machines
- Azure Bot Service

- Computer vision: image classification, object detection (label/bounding boxes), OCR, **real time video analysis!**
- Speech to text/Text to speech

- Azure Data Explorer: Fast and highly scalable data exploration service
- Azure Maps: provide geospatial context
- Azure mobile app: run commands to manage your Azure resources. 

Would be cool if you find somewhere pipelines using a bundle of these.
