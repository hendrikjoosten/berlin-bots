You don't say if you have a monitor and keyboard on the Pi. 
If you do then you can find the IP address from the command line interface with "ifconfig"

For running a Pi headless I suggest:
1. Download Raspbian rather than NOOBS (In the post christmas rush, I've found the torrent download the best)
2. Write it to the SD card with Win32DiskImager
3 Still on your PC, put an empty file "ssh" on the card to enable SSH. ssh.txt might work too.
4 Still on your PC, put a file "wpa_supplicant.conf" on the card containing
Code: Select all

country=GB
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="Your SSID Here"
    psk="YourWifiKeyHere"
}
5. Put the card in the Pi and boot it up. Now it will hopefully connect to your Wifi.
6. Find the IP address from your router setup pages, with Advanced IP Scanner on your PC or Fing on android
7. Connect by ssh with Putty
8. Change pi's password.
